- in this folder we will have our js files
- javascript is a functional programming language so our program must be broken into some of functions
- we must think of the program as a collection of parts (or files), each file contain some functions to do related tasks
- each one will work on some of them


- we must accomplish the following (requirements)
    * fancy GUI :D
    * Drawing the signal flow graph
    * Listing of all florward paths, individual loops, all combinations of n non-touching loops
    * Calulating all forward paths gains, individual loops gain, all combinations of n non-touching loops gains (to calcualte delta)
    * calculating delta for each forward path
    
    
- The program workflow will be the following:
    1.  Taking the SFG info from the user. Regardless of the way (i.e. drag and drop or text fields), we must have nodes and branches associated    with gains.
    2.  Creating SignalFlowGraph object and Calling the needed methods to fulfill the requirements.
    3.  Showing the output to the user (back to GUI).
    

- the logic behind:

    1. Listing (and calualting) all forward paths:
        The user must assign the source node and the destination node.
        Start the traversal from source. If we reach the destination, print that path. Calculate its gain. Continue the traversal till finish.
        
    2. Listing all individual loops
        naive algorithm ?!
        tarjan, johnson -> complicated implementation
        
    3. Listing all n non-touching loops
        for i = 2 to #nodes
            find all i-combinations of nodes
            for each combination
                test if the loops is non-touching   (if so, calcualte the gain)
                
    4. calculating delta for each forward path
        for each forward path
            if it touches with any loop, remove the loop
